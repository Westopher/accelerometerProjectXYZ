# accelerometerProjectXYZ

This project displays information from the accelerometer over 3 planes via three labels. It is rather fun to use in real time.

Simply clone the repo, open it in Xcode, upload it to your phone using the simulator (plug your phone into your computer first),
and you can see, in real time, the angles and locations recorded by your phone of its activity.
